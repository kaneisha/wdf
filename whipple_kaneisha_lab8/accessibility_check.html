			<p>The following are sites that needed to be reviewed to see if they have the proper HTML5 structural elements.

		<h2><a href="http://www.alicedrougard.com/">Alice Drougard</a></h2>
			<p>This a portfolio site for Alice Drougard. She is an industrial product designer and this site shows off the work that she's done. After reviewing her site she had errors pertaining to keyboard accessibility where she has to fix not having an onblur on the script. She had an invalid language code and that can be fixed by identifying the document. She also has to put an text on her alt tag to describe the function and purpose of the image.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://massimoscucina.ca/">Massimo&#039;s Cucina Italiana</a></h2>
			<p>This is a site for a restaurant. It shows what the restaurant is about and its menu along with contact information so you can reserve a table. It is a very high-end restaurant. After reviewing their markup I saw that they did use HTML5 structural elements correctly.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://www.loafcreative.com/">Loaf Creative</a></h2>
			<p>This is a site for a design company. This site is intended to be like a portfolio for them showing their previous work and the brands they've worked for. After reviewing their markup I saw that they did use HTML5 structural elements correctly.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://www.alln1hob.com/#home">All-N-1 House of Beauty</a></h2>
			<p>This is a site for a salon for women. The site tells the services they offer and examples of what they do and their contact information. After reviewing their markup I noticed they had some problems with their HTML5 structural elements. Their problems consisted of having an opening element like an article or a section then closing it without adding any headers to it. They can fix this problem by simply adding an header in the sections or articles before closing it.</p>
