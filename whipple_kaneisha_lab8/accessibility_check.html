		<h1>Accessibility Check</h1>
			<p>The following are sites that needed to be reviewed to see if they are accessible for people with disabilities.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://www.alicedrougard.com/">Alice Drougard</a></h2>
			<p>This a portfolio site for Alice Drougard. She is an industrial product designer and this site shows off the work that she's done. After checking the site's accessibility I found she had errors pertaining to keyboard accessibility where she has to fix not having an onblur on the script. She had an invalid language code and that can be fixed by identifying the document. She also has to put an text on her alt tag to describe the function and purpose of the image.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://chop-chop.org/">Chop-Chop</a></h2>
			<p>This site is a xhtml converter. It turns psd's into xhtml. After checking the site's accessibility I found there were no errors.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://markup.io/">Markup</a></h2>
			<p>This is a site that lets you take a shape and put it in your toolbar so you can use it to draw on any web page later. After checking the site's accessibility I found it had errors because the images didn't have an alt attribute. To fix that all they need to do is add an alt attribute so screen readers can tell what the image is. They also didn't have their headers in order which was the cause of another error. Finally they had a language error which all they need to do is identify the language that they're using.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://allisonhou.se/">Allison House</a></h2>
			<p>This is a site for an interface designer named Allison. It's more like a contact site for you to reach her and a blog to ask her questions. After checking the site's accessibility I found her site has no errors. I guess that makes her a good designer!</p>
